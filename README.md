# Welcome to CISWebsite.github.io
This is where code for the IEEE CIS Historical Society's web-based timeline project can be found.
Branches in this project will contain experimental html/css/javascript files which might be implemented into the final website.
When the new website is finished, it will be integrated with the IEEE CIS' current back-end system, assuming it is safe to do so.
Anyone who can view this project is free to comment on it.
## Thank you!
